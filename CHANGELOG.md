## [1.21.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- **Robust Card Identification System**: Implemented `baseId` field for reliable card identification
  - **Problem Solved**: Cards from rewards, shops, and events get unique IDs (e.g., `whirlwind_debug_1748453215440`) but game logic was using `card.id` for identification
  - **Solution**: Added `baseId` field to Card interface that remains consistent across all card instances
  - **Implementation**: Updated all card definitions to include `baseId` field matching their core identity
  - **Benefits**: Eliminates bugs where card-specific logic fails due to unique ID generation

### Fixed
- **Card Identification Bugs**: Fixed all instances where `card.id` was used for card type identification
  - **Whirlwind Energy Logic**: Now uses `card.baseId === 'whirlwind'` instead of `card.id === 'whirlwind'`
  - **HandArea Card Display**: Updated cost display, special effects, and playability checks to use `baseId`
  - **UI Components**: Fixed card cost display in ShopScreen, CardRewardScreen, UnifiedHeader, and GameUI
  - **Damage Debugging**: Updated damage debugger to use `baseId` for whirlwind identification
  - **Card Creation**: Updated all card copying/creation logic to preserve `baseId` when generating unique IDs

### Enhanced
- **Card Utility Functions**: Added robust helper functions for card identification
  - `getCardByBaseId(baseId: string)`: Get card definition by baseId
  - `hasBaseId(card: Card, baseId: string)`: Check if card matches baseId
  - Updated `isMultiTargetCard()` and `cardNeedsTarget()` to use baseId-based identification
  - **Future-Proof**: System now supports any number of card instances without identification conflicts

### Technical Details
- **Card Interface**: Added required `baseId: string` field to Card interface
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained existing `id` field for instance identification
- **Consistent Naming**: `baseId` matches the card's core identifier (e.g., 'whirlwind', 'strike', 'cleave')
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests verifying baseId identification works with unique IDs

## [1.20.10] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
- **Whirlwind Energy Consumption Logic**: Fixed critical bug where whirlwind wasn't consuming all available energy correctly
  - **Root Cause**: Card identification logic was using `card.id` instead of `card.name` for whirlwind detection
  - **Issue**: Cards from rewards get unique IDs (e.g., `whirlwind_debug_1748452066192`) but whirlwind logic only checked for `card.id === 'whirlwind'`
  - **Solution**: Changed whirlwind detection to use `card.name === 'Whirlwind'` for reliable identification

### Fixed
- **Critical Cleave Double Damage Bug**: Fixed Cleave dealing 16 damage instead of 8
  - Cleave card had both `damage: 8` property AND `effects: [{ type: DAMAGE, value: 8 }]`
  - This caused the game to apply damage twice: once from the damage property, once from the effect
  - **Solution**: Removed the duplicate `damage` property from Cleave card definition

  - Ensured consistent damage calculation across all card types
  - Preserved all existing functionality while fixing the double damage bug

### Verified Working
- **Card Damage Calculations**: All damage values now accurate and consistent
  - **Cleave**: 8 damage to all enemies (not 16) ✅
  - **Whirlwind**: 0/5/10/15 damage based on energy (0/1/2/3) ✅
  - **Other Cards**: All existing damage calculations unchanged ✅
  - **Status Effects**: Vulnerable, weak, strength all apply correctly ✅

## [1.18.0] - 2024-12-19

### Fixed
